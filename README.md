# Social Network

## About the Project
This application was created to be a rough frame for a social networking app. Using insomnia you can test routes to create, update, and delete a User. That user is then able to create, update, and delete thoughts they created, add another user as a friend, remove another user as a friend, and can add and remove a comment they made on another user's thought. Simply clone the repository and do "npm install" to install all the dependencies and then load up insomnia and test the routes that are created in the "routes" directory.
